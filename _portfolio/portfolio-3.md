In few hours, we designed a traval planning agent using HuggingFace's library smolagents, integrated with DuckDuckgo for information retrieval and a browser tool for booking accommodations and activities. The agent can understand user preferences, search for relevant information, and make bookings autonomously. Main features include real-time web browsing, structured data extraction, multi-budget handling, and personalized itinerary generation.
We achieved third-place in the hackathon.
