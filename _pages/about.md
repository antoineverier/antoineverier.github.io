I’m Antoine Verier, a data science master’s student at Institut Polytechnique de Paris and Télécom Paris, specializing in computer vision, signal processing, and machine learning. I’m currently looking for a 4–6 month internship starting in April or May 2026 to build products with measurable impact. You will find my CV on this website and a portfolio of my projects.
