Education
======
- Institut Polytechnique de Paris — Master 2 in Data Science (09/2025–09/2026)  
  Coursework: Monte Carlo methods and approximate inference; statistical learning theory; optimization for data science; optimal transport; reinforcement learning; ML with graphs; generative models; representation learning for computer vision.[1]
- Télécom Paris — Engineering degree, major in Computer Vision and Signal Processing (09/2022–12/2026)  
  Coursework: optimization for ML, statistics, signal processing, databases, time series; computer vision (image processing, generative models, medical and satellite imaging, deep learning, 3D).[1]
- Sainte‑Geneviève High School (Classes Préparatoires PC) — Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry (09/2020–09/2022)  
  Intensive two‑year preparatory program for competitive French engineering schools.[1]

Work experience
======
- BNP Paribas CIB — Research Data Scientist Intern, Data & Analytics Consulting (Paris, 04/2025–09/2025)  
  - Studied RAG evaluation frameworks (RAGAS) focusing on response accuracy, factuality, and contextual accuracy.[1]
  - Used LLM‑as‑a‑judge methods to verify correlation with human judgment on open‑source general knowledge and finance datasets; evaluated context precision with small fine‑tuned models (~100M params) at token/sentence/chunk levels.[1]
  - Developed a proof‑of‑concept using agentic frameworks (Smolagents, CrewAI) for automated email drafting and financial product recommendation.[1]

- Interdisciplinary Laboratory for Socio‑Ecological Simulation — Research Data Scientist Intern (Ottawa, 07/2024–12/2024)  
  - Improved a ResNet‑34–based classifier with two additional heads to detect beluga sound activity using new data.[1]
  - Built spatiotemporal models to forecast whale presence/absence from underwater noise in the St. Lawrence Channel and analyzed environmental variables correlated with beluga vocal activity.[1]

Projects
======
- SinGAN (Generative Models) — Implemented “SinGAN: Learning a Generative Model From a Single Natural Image,” adapting the cost function to compare patch distributions.[1]
- Cancerous Melanoma Detection — ISIC dataset; segmentation with U‑Net; feature embedding and ABCDE rules; classification with scikit‑learn.[1]
- Junior Enterprise (Télécom Paris) — Project Manager & Quality Supervisor: led a team of four, monitored and audited ISO9001 compliance, and conducted internal document verification.[1]
- MARGO Hackathon (+IBM, Qubit Pharmaceuticals) — Developed ML models to predict cardiac toxicity of chemical compounds; awarded first prize (weekend sprint).[1]
